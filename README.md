> Exploring how to build a tool that understands Python code structure.

## The Problem

I need to build something that can:
- Read Python source code
- Extract meaningful information (classes, functions)
- Show relationships between code elements

## First Questions

- What does "code intelligence" actually mean?
- How do you parse Python programmatically?
- What's the difference between text parsing and understanding structure?

## Initial Research

Looking into Python's `ast` module - it can parse source code into a tree structure.
This seems more powerful than regex for understanding code.

*More notes to come as I learn...*
